# Cure

Our mission is to use advanced technology to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients, and to provide accessible, high-quality healthcare to everyone.
At Cure, we understand that technology can play a crucial role in improving healthcare outcomes. That's why we have developed a range of machine learning algorithms specifically designed to detect patients and provide healthcare solutions. These algorithms use complex mathematical models and statistical techniques to analyze vast amounts of data and identify patterns that may indicate the presence of various health conditions.

Our team of experts includes machine learning specialists and data scientists who work together to develop and implement these algorithms. With their combined expertise, we are able to deliver healthcare solutions that make a real difference in people's lives.

At Cure, we believe that everyone deserves access to the best possible healthcare. That's why we are dedicated to using the latest technology to improve diagnosis and treatment, and to make healthcare more accessible and affordable for everyone.


## 1-PCOS
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder among women of reproductive age. It is characterized by the presence of cysts in the ovaries, irregular menstrual cycles, and elevated levels of androgens (male hormones).

## 2-Diabetes
Diabetes is a chronic condition characterized by high levels of glucose (sugar) in the blood. It can lead to a range of serious health complications if left untreated. Early diagnosis and management of diabetes is crucial for preventing these complications and maintaining good health.

To address these issues, our team is developing a web application that utilizes machine learning to make predictions. Specifically, the application will utilize the Random Forest algorithm.

Random Forest is a powerful, non-parametric machine learning algorithm that is widely used for classification and regression tasks. It works by creating a multitude of decision trees, each trained on a random subset of the data, and then aggregating their results to produce a final prediction. The algorithm is particularly effective for high-dimensional and complex data sets, making it a suitable choice for our web application.

The Random Forest algorithm will be trained on a large dataset of patients, allowing it to identify patterns and relationships between various features and the presence of the condition. Once trained, the algorithm will be able to make predictions about the likelihood of a patient having that condition based on their demographic information, medical history, and other relevant factors.

In conclusion, the web application is a cutting-edge project that utilizes the power of machine learning to tackle a pressing health issue. The use of the Random Forest algorithm will allow for accurate and reliable predictions, ultimately improving the diagnosis and treatment of patients.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
